# 🧠 Logistic Regression Projects – Binary & Multiclass Classification

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of **Logistic Regression** projects designed to demonstrate both **binary** and **multiclass classification** problems in machine learning. Real-world datasets such as **HR attrition data**, **insurance customer data**, and the popular **Iris flower dataset** are used to explore the theory, implementation, and performance of logistic regression models using Python and Scikit-learn.

## 📌 What You Will Learn

- Fundamentals of Logistic Regression (sigmoid function, decision boundary)
- Difference between Binary and Multiclass Classification
- Model training, evaluation, and improvement strategies
- Working with real-world datasets: preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering
- Performance evaluation using confusion matrix, classification report, and F1-score
- One-vs-Rest (OvR) and Softmax (Multinomial) strategies for multiclass problems
